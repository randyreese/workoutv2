When you start the new conversation, just say something like:

"This is a fork of the workout health tracking project (original: https://github.com/randyreese/workout). I want to enhance it with [your specific enhancements here - e.g., 'visualization, data validation, web interface', etc.]"

That's it! I'll be able to:

Read the files in the repo to understand the codebase
See your git history
Pick up where we left off
Optional but helpful:
If you know which enhancements you want (from the list I mentioned earlier or your own ideas), have those ready. Otherwise, we can discuss options when you're ready.

One small tip: When you open workoutv2 in VSCode, you might want to close the modelproject workspace first, or use "File → Open Folder" to switch workspaces cleanly.

You're all set! See you in the workoutv2 conversation whenever you're ready to start enhancing. 👍
